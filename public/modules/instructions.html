<h1>Instructions</h1>
<p>Hello, for the next while you will be completing some trials.</p>

<h2>What are these trials?</h2>
<p> Once you beign you will see dots moving across the display.  Your goal is to accurately click as many <mark id="red">red</mark> dots as possible, once a <mark id="red">red</mark> dot is clicked a new one will pop up somewhere on the screen.  You must click as many dots as you can within 5-10 seconds.  After time is up you will be prompted with a screen where you will click the number representing how many <mark id="blue">blue</mark> dots you saw on the screen right before time was up. </p>
