<h1>Instructions</h1>
<p>Hello, for the next while you will be completing some trials.</p>

<h2>What are these trials?</h2>
<p>Your goal is to click as many <mark id="red">red</mark> dots as possible, once a <mark id="red">red</mark> dot is clicked a new one will pop up somewhere on the screen.  You must click as many dots as you can within 5-10 seconds.  After time is up you will be prompted with a screen where you will click the number representing how many <mark id="blue">blue</mark> dots you saw on the screen right before time was up. </p>

<h2>How do I tell what's what?</h2>
<p>Your cursor is a crosshair that moves with your mouse, whenever your crosshair is over a dot it's border will darken and get thicker.  Whenever you click on a dot it will flash.  After clicking a <mark id="red">red</mark> dot the new <mark id="red">red</mark> dot will enter flashing.</p>

<h2>How do these techniques work?</h2>
<p> Each technique has a different freeze region which is shown via a gray, highlighted area on your screen.  When you hit 'Shift' the dots inside the highlighted region will freeze in place. <p>
<p>NOTE: Once a <mark id="red">red</mark> dot is frozen and it's original goes off screen you will only have 2 seconds to click it.</p>

<h2>Will I be able to test the techniques before using them?</h2>
<p>Of course! Before using any new technique/trail combination you will be allowed practice.  You may practice as much as you want and during you will be told how many <mark id="blue">blue</mark> dots you guessed correctly!</p>
<p>NOTE: Practice at least 4 times so you can get an idea of the various speed/density combinations you will encounter with each technique/trail combination!</p>
