`StreamScatterPlot.js` creates a scatter plot that shows data over time:

* Using the mouse wheel will cause the time to increase/decrease
* Spacebar will pause the chart
* New data can easily be pushed to chart using `pushDatum`

`freeze_selectors` folder contains various freeze selection methods.

`cursor_selectors` folder contains normal cursor (will actually update selection on redraws) and bubble cursor.

Class(.) and ID(#) names for reference in use with Javascript/CSS.
